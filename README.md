# Predicting AQI Using Advanced Machine Learning and Data Analytics

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) and applies machine learning techniques to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) for different countries based on pollutant metrics. It includes statistical visualizations, regression modeling, and an interactive tool for generating country-specific AQI reports.
